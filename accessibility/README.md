# ARIA's main purpose:

ARIA, which stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications, is a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve the accessibility of web content, particularly for users with disabilities. ARIA helps make web applications and dynamic content more accessible by providing additional semantics and interaction mechanisms for assistive technologies like screen readers.

ARIA attributes can enhance the accessibility of web content by providing information about the role, state, and properties of UI components that are not otherwise conveyed by the HTML markup alone. This includes things like defining landmarks, describing live regions, indicating focusable elements, and more.

# WCAG conformance levels (A, AA, and AAA):

WCAG, or Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, are a set of guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These guidelines are designed to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. The WCAG guidelines are organized into four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Each principle has associated guidelines and success criteria.

```
    WCAG conformance levels are divided into three
    levels:
    A, AA, and AAA.
    These levels indicate the degree to which a
    website or web application conforms
    to the WCAG guidelines.
```
* Level A:
    This level addresses the most basic web accessibility features. Conforming to Level A ensures that some users with disabilities can access the content.
* Level AA:
    This level addresses a higher level of accessibility, including many of the most common barriers for disabled users. Conforming to Level AA makes the content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities.
* Level AAA:
    This level represents the highest level of accessibility, addressing the most advanced and specific accessibility issues. Conforming to Level AAA makes the content accessible to the broadest range of users, including those with more severe disabilities.

# The importance of Web Accessibility:

Web accessibility is crucial for ensuring that everyone, regardless of disability, can access and interact with web content. By making websites and web applications accessible, you not only comply with legal requirements but also ensure inclusivity and equal access for all users. Web accessibility benefits not only people with disabilities but also improves the user experience for everyone, including older users, users with temporary disabilities, users in challenging environments, and users on mobile devices.

# Tools to use for Web Accessibility:

There are several tools available to help developers ensure web accessibility:

* Lighthouse:
    An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. It includes accessibility audits as one of its features.

* axe:
    Developed by Deque Systems, axe is an accessibility testing toolkit that can be integrated into development workflows. It provides automated accessibility testing for web pages.

* WAVE:
    Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) is a browser extension and web-based tool that provides visual feedback about the accessibility of web content by injecting icons and indicators into the web page.

* Chrome Accessibility Developer Tools:
    A set of developer tools for the Chrome browser that helps identify accessibility issues in web pages.

* Screen Readers:
    While not a developer tool per se, screen readers like NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) and VoiceOver (for macOS/iOS) are essential for testing accessibility from a user perspective.

* Keyboard Navigation Testing:
    Manually testing keyboard accessibility is also crucial. Developers should ensure that all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using only the keyboard.
